# IamSafe-Mobile-Application-Xamarin-Project
Mobile application which written in Xamarin.Forms. It is created for communication between natural disaster victims and their family or friends.

## Subject

Telecommunication services are usually not available in case of natural disasters, especially earthquakes in Turkey.
Everyone tries to reach their intimates in the disaster zone but they can not reach them via phone call. My project comes with the solution to that problem.

## Main Screen

Users can inform their status to database that they are safe with that page in case of disasters.

## Find Person Screen

In this page, users can check their relatives in case of disasters if their relatives used "I am safe" page. That means if they send their
information to the database.

## Need Help Screen

If users are in emergency, they can directly hit the "Help"  button to call authorities. This button locate the person with GPS and send their
latitude and longitude to a database. If they prefer to enter required information, their information also logged to database along with GPS location.
